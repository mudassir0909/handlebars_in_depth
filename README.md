handlebars_in_depth
===================
Up until now while using Handlebars in EmberJS it has been all magic. With this I'm trying to learn in depth(not too deep
but deep enough to not feel magical anymore) how handlebars works internal & should be able to write more powerful yet
expressive handlebar helpers. 

### context
This code was written while I was reviewing "Instant Handlebars.js by PacktLib"
